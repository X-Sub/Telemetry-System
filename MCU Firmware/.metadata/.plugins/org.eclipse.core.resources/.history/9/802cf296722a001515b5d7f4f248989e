                preferred method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and 
                <OnBreak> the return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the

                read.
   - SerialCom_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.

                non-zero length of the input buffer is defined and the receiver property is enabled.  If less than requested 
                number of characters is received only the available data is copied from the receive buffer to the user 
                specified destination. The value ERR_EXEMPTY is returned and the value of variable pointed by the Rcv parameter 
                is set to the number of received characters.
   - SerialCom_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters to the channel.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the 
                output buffer is defined and the transmitter property is enabled.

                defined and the receiver property is enabled.

                is defined and the receiver property is enabled.

                receiver property is enabled.

                transmitter property is enabled.

                A/D converter.
   - ADC_GetChanValue -Returns the last measured value of the required channel. Format and width of the value is a native 
                format of the A/D converter.

                returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD resolution> is less than

                <Starting pulse width> property.
   - LedLight2_SetDutyMS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in milliseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.

Module "Cpu"       (component MCF51QE128_80)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_Delay100US -This method realizes software delay. The length of delay is at least 100 microsecond multiply input 
                parameter [us100]. As the delay implementation is not based on real clock, the delay time may be increased by 
                interrupt service routines processed during the delay. The method is independent on selected speed mode.
