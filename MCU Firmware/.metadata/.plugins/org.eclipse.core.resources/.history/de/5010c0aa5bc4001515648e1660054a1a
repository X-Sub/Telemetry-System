/*!
**     @brief
**         This method returns the last measured value of the required
**         channel. Compared with [GetChanValue] method this method
**         returns more accurate result if the [number of conversions]
**         is greater than 1 and [AD resolution] is less than 16 bits.
**         In addition, the user code dependency on [AD resolution] is
**         eliminated.
**     @param
**         Channel         - Channel number. If only one
**                           channel in the component is set then this
**                           parameter is ignored.
**     @param
**         Value           - Pointer to the measured value.
**     @return
**                         - Error code, possible codes:
**                           ERR_OK - OK

**                           the active speed mode
**                           ERR_NOTAVAIL - Requested value not
**                           available
**                           ERR_RANGE - Parameter "Channel" out of

**                           ERR_OVERRUN - External trigger overrun flag
