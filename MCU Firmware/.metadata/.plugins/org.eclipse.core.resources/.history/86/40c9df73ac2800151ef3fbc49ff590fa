                preferred method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and 
                <OnBreak> the return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the

                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.
