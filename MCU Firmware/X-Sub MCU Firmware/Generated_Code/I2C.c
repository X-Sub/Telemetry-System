**     Abstract    :
**          This component encapsulates the internal I2C communication 
**          interface. The implementation of the interface is based 
**          on the Philips I2C-bus specification version 2.0. 
**          Interface features:
**          MASTER mode
**            - Multi master communication
**            - The combined format of communication possible 
**              (see "Automatic stop condition" property)
**            - 7-bit slave addressing (10-bit addressing can be made as well)
**            - Acknowledge polling provided
**            - No wait state initiated when a slave device holds the SCL line low
**            - Holding of the SCL line low by slave device recognized as 'not available bus'
**            - Invalid start/stop condition detection provided
**          SLAVE mode
**            - 7-bit slave addressing
**            - General call address detection provided

** ===================================================================
**     Method      :  I2C_SendChar (component InternalI2C)
**     Description :
**         When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit
**         addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address bytes
**         inclusive of R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes one
**         character (byte) to the bus. The slave address must be
**         specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SelectSlave10"
**         method or in the component initialization section, "Target
**         slave address init" property. If interrupt service is
**         enabled and the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that
**         transmission was successful. The state of transmission is
**         obtainable from (OnTransmitData, OnError or OnArbitLost)
**         events. 
**         When working as a SLAVE, this method writes a character to
**         the internal output slave buffer and, after the master
**         starts the communication, to the I2C bus. If no character is
**         ready for a transmission (internal output slave buffer is
**         empty), the Empty character will be sent (see "Empty
**         character" property).
**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**         Chr             - Character to send.
**     Returns     :
**         ---             - Error code, possible codes:
**                           ERR_OK - OK
**                           ERR_SPEED - This device does not work in
**                           the active speed mode
**                           ERR_DISABLED -  Device is disabled
**                           ERR_BUSY - The slave device is busy, it
**                           does not respond by an acknowledge (only in
**                           master mode and when interrupt service is
**                           disabled)
**                           ERR_BUSOFF - Clock timeout elapsed or

**     Description :
**         When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit
**         addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address bytes
**         inclusive of R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus, then reads one
**         character (byte) from the bus and then sends the stop
**         condition. The slave address must be specified before, by
**         the "SelectSlave" or "SelectSlave10" method or in component
**         initialization section, property "Target slave address init".
**         If interrupt service is enabled and the method returns
**         ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was finished
**         successfully. The state of transmission must be tested by
**         means of events (OnReceiveData, OnError or OnArbitLost). In
**         case of successful transmission, received data is ready
**         after OnReceiveData event is called. 
**         When working as a SLAVE, this method reads a character from

**  This method is implemented as a macro. See I2C.h file.  **
*/

/*
** ===================================================================
**     Method      :  I2C_SendBlock (component InternalI2C)
**     Description :
**         When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit
**         addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address bytes
**         inclusive of R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes the
**         block of characters to the bus. The slave address must be
**         specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SlaveSelect10"
**         method or in component initialization section, "Target slave
**         address init" property. If interrupt service is enabled and
**         the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission
**         was successful. The state of transmission is detectable by
**         means of events (OnTransmitData, OnError or OnArbitLost).
**         Data to be send is not copied to an internal buffer and
**         remains in the original location. Therefore the content of
**         the buffer should not be changed until the transmission is
**         complete. Event OnTransmitData can be used to detect the end
**         of the transmission.
**         When working as a SLAVE, this method writes a block of
**         characters to the internal output slave buffer and then,
**         after the master starts the communication, to the I2C bus.
**         If no character is ready for a transmission (internal output
**         slave buffer is empty), the "Empty character" will be sent
**         (see "Empty character" property). In SLAVE mode the data are
**         copied to an internal buffer, if specified by "Output buffer
**         size" property.
**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**       * Ptr             - Pointer to the block of data to send.
**         Siz             - Size of the block.
**       * Snt             - Amount of data sent (moved to a buffer).
**                           In master mode, if interrupt support is
**                           enabled, the parameter always returns the
**                           same value as the parameter 'Siz' of this
**                           method.
**     Returns     :

**                           ERR_OK - OK

**                           does not respond by the acknowledge (only
**                           in master mode and when interrupt service
**                           is disabled)
**                           ERR_BUSOFF - Clock timeout elapsed or
**                           device cannot transmit data
**                           ERR_TXFULL - Transmitter is full. Some data
