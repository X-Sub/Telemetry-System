                0248", it will return the (signed) integral and fractional part with number of fractional zeros. The function 
                accepts as well numbers  like "17" (no fractional part" or "17.0"

                writing a zero byte to the string!)

Module "TEMP1"     (component LM61B)
   - TEMP1_Measure -Starts the measuring process for the sensor value.
   - TEMP1_ReadTemperature -Reads the temperature from the sensor.

Module "AD1"       (component ADC)
   - AD1_Measure -This method performs one measurement on all channels that are set in the component inspector. (Note: If the 
                <number of conversions> is more than one the conversion of A/D channels is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_MeasureChan -This method performs measurement on one channel. (Note: If the <number of conversions> is more than one 
                the conversion of the A/D channel is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_GetChanValue -Returns the last measured value of the required channel. Format and width of the value is a native 
                format of the A/D converter.
   - AD1_GetValue8 -This method returns the last measured values of all channels. Compared with <GetValue> method this method 
                returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD resolution> is less than 
                8 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.
   - AD1_GetChanValue8 -This method returns the last measured value of the required channel. Compared with <GetChanValue> 
                method this method returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD 
                resolution> is less than 8 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.
   - AD1_GetValue16 -This method returns the last measured values of all channels. Compared with <GetValue> method this method 
                returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD resolution> is less than 
                16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.
   - AD1_GetChanValue16 -This method returns the last measured value of the required channel. Compared with <GetChanValue> 
                method this method returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD 
                resolution> is less than 16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.

Module "Cpu"       (component MCF51QE128_80)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables maskable interrupts
