# X-Sub Telemetry System
X-Sub Telemetry System is a project developed by the Mechatronics Research and Development Group (MRDG) at the Simon Bolivar University. The project aims to create a telemetry system for remote teleoperation of underwater robots and related technologies for research, exploration, and underwater inspection.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you need to fork your own copy of X-Sub/Telemetry-System. After forking, you can clone the project to your local machine and start working on it.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into different branches, and each branch contains code related to a specific module of the project. The branches include:

* LabView Visualizer
* MCU Firmware
* PCB
* Python Data Receiver-Transmitter
* Spectrum Analyzer

Additionally, there are other files included in the project such as a readme, gitignore, and gitattributes files.

## Usage
The X-Sub Telemetry System is designed to provide remote teleoperation of underwater robots. It consists of a 32-bit microcontroller that acquires sensor signals and centralizes them to a PC board. The PC board keeps a record of all data and forwards them to a base station, which commands for control motors and other actuators on board are received.
